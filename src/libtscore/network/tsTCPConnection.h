    //!
    //! Base class for a TCP/IP session.
    //! @ingroup libtscore net
    //!
    //! This class can be used directly by applications or can be derived to create specific
    //! sub-classes which handle application protocols.
    //!
    //! This class is used in two contexts:
    //! - A TCP/IP client creates a TCPConnection instance and @e connects to a server.
    //! - A TCP/IP server creates a TCPServer instance and @e waits for clients. For each
    //!   client session, a TCPConnection instance is created.
    //!
    //! For a detailed scenario of the server side, see the class TCPServer.
    //!
    //! The following lists the typical client-side scenario in the correct order.
    //! Many steps such as setting socket options are optional. The symbol [*] means mandatory.
    //! Depending on the platform, some options settings are sensitive to the order.
    //! The following order has proven to work on most platforms.
    //!
    //! - [*] open()
    //! - reusePort()
    //! - setSendBufferSize()
    //! - setReceiveBufferSize()
    //! - setLingerTime() / setNoLinger()
    //! - setKeepAlive()
    //! - setNoDelay()
    //! - setTTL()
    //! - [*] bind()
    //! - [*] connect()
    //! - send() / receive()
    //! - closeWriter()
    //! - disconnect()
    //! - close()
    //!
    //! Invoking close() is optional since the destructor of the class will properly
    //! close the socket if not already done. Invoking disconnect() is also optional
    //! but is highly recommended. Closing a socket without prior disconnect is
    //! considered as a session abort by the remote peer. The peer may thus consider
    //! that something went wrong may take unexpected corrective or rollback actions.
    //!
